Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism that enhances account protection by requiring users to provide two separate forms of identification before gaining access to an account or system. It adds an extra layer of security compared to traditional single-factor authentication methods like just a password.
Overview of the Process
Step 1:

The user enters their email and password in the application.
The system generates a One-Time Password (OTP) and sends it to the user via a communication channel (typically email or SMS).
Step 2:

The user inputs the received OTP into the application.
The app verifies if the entered OTP matches the one that was generated.
Final Step:

If the OTP is correct, the user is authenticated and allowed to proceed (e.g., directed to a new activity or dashboard).
If the OTP is incorrect, the user is notified and asked to try again.
